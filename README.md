# 🏛️ The Regulatory Prompt Library (Open Source)

**Automate your Regulatory Drafting. ISO 13485 | MDR | IVDR | FDA | GMP.**

> "Prompt Engineering is a commodity. Regulatory Intelligence is the asset." - [ADHOCON](https://adhocon.com)

## 🎯 The Mission
Consultants charge thousands for "AI Workshops". We believe the basic instructions (Prompts) should be free.
This repository contains thousands of **programmatically validated prompts** that ensure your AI (ChatGPT, Copilot, Claude) adheres to the correct regulations.

## 🛡️ Compliance by Design
Unlike random prompt lists, this library is generated via a logical matrix (`main.py`) to prevent hallucinations:
* **MedTech Prompts** only cite MDR/ISO 13485.
* **Pharma Prompts** only cite GMP/ICH Q10.
* **SaMD Prompts** strictly enforce IEC 62304.

## 📂 How to use
1. **Download** the `adhocon_regulatory_prompts.csv` file from the file list above.
2. **Filter** the CSV for your Sector (e.g., "IVD") and Task (e.g., "Gap Analysis").
3. **Copy** the prompt from the "Prompt" column.
4. **Paste** into ChatGPT Enterprise, MS Copilot, or Claude.

## 🔗 Powered by ADHOCON
We automate the rest.
* **Need more?** We build **Agentic QMS Frameworks** that execute these tasks autonomously in your Azure/AWS cloud.
